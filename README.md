How to install Arduino in Ubuntu using Virtual Machine Box
------------------------------------------
Task 2- Robotics and AI in Smart Methods Summer Training Program
------------------------------------------
Step #1 : Open the Ubuntu Virtual Machine that you want to install Arduino in

Step #2 : Open the browser in the Virtual Machine and search for Arduino download,
This site:

https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Then, go to downloads the Linux option thats the same as the one that was created for the Virtual Machine,
I choose Linux 64 bits since it's the same as my Virtual Machine.

Step #3 : Once the download is complete go to 'Downloads' in files and click on 'Extract Here',
once the file is extracted drag and drop the flie in 'Home'

Step 4 :  Click on 'install' that's inside the file, then open the terminal
write as follows:

$ cd arduino

$ ls

$ sudo ./install.sh

[enter password]

After a couple of minutes it will be installed, Done.
